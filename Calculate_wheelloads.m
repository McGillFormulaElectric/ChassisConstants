function [ OUT_Fz_FL, OUT_Fz_FR, OUT_Fz_RL, OUT_Fz_RR ] = Calculate_wheelLoads( Vehicle, glat, glong )

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%This function calculates all four wheel loads for a given vehicle under a
%combined longitudinal acceleration and lateral acceleration. 

%Reference: 

%Lateral LT: RCVD p. 683, using the simplified Lateral Load transfer
%calculations.

%Longitudinal LT: RCVD p. 684
